# this project is based on two Subject:
**1) Generating interface for connection between Slave and Master of Surgery Robot:**  
    By using the Tkinter library in Python, this environment runs on a Raspberry Pi and displays a UI that assists in controlling and moving the master’s arms during surgery, enabling the use of the robot’s arms.


**2) TCP Connection between Slave and Master for Data transformation:**
  For the arm movements, some information from the slave is required. Using this data, I can simulate the movements in the UI interface. To achieve this, we wrote a TCP connection script.
